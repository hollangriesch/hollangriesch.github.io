    "section": "",
    "text": "There is no doubt that Jimmy Butler has been a star in the NBA since he came into the league in 2011. However, I believe that the impact he has had, particularly in the postseason, is significantly underrated.\nButler earned the nickname “Playoff Jimmy” during his performance in the NBA bubble in the 2020 postseason when he lead the Heat all the way to the finals. This marked the first time since 1999 that a team seeded 5th or lower made it the finals.\nAlready this postseason, Butler has lead the No.8 Heat passed the top-seeded Milwaukee Bucks in just five games. This feat was extra impressive considering that Miami was missing their third leading scorer, Tyler Herro, and their fifth leading scorer, Victor Oladipo due to injuries.\nLet’s see where Jimmy Butler ranks among some of the league’s best when it comes to postseason performance.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nnbaplayerbox <- hoopR::load_nba_player_box(2022)\n\npostseason2022 <- nbaplayerbox %>% filter(game_date > \"2022-04-16\" & game_date <= \"2022-06-16\")\n\nplayers <- c(\"Jimmy Butler\", \"James Harden\", \"Stephen Curry\", \"Giannis Antetokounmpo\",\"Klay Thompson\")\n\nnewnba <- postseason2022 %>% \n  filter(athlete_display_name %in% players) %>%\n  select(athlete_display_name, field_goals_made, field_goals_attempted, steals, rebounds, points) %>%\n  mutate_at(vars(-athlete_display_name), as.numeric) %>%\n  group_by(athlete_display_name) %>%\n  summarize(\n    TotalFG = sum(field_goals_made),\n    TotalFGA = sum(field_goals_attempted),\n    Steals = sum(steals),\n    Rebounds = sum(rebounds),\n    Points = sum(points)\n  ) %>%\n  mutate(FGPct = TotalFG/TotalFGA) %>%\n  rename(Name = athlete_display_name) %>%\n  select(Name, FGPct, Steals, Rebounds, Points) %>%\n  arrange(desc(FGPct))\n\nnewnba %>% \n  gt() %>%\n  cols_label(\n    FGPct = \"Shooting Percentage\"\n  ) %>%\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"How Jimmy Butler Ranks in Playoff Shooting Percentage\",\n    subtitle = \"Butler tops the list with the best shooting percentage in the 2022 playoffs\"\n  ) %>% tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) %>% tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) %>%\n tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Hollan Griesch  |  **Source:** hoopR: The SportsDataverse's R Package for Men's Basketball Data\")\n  ) %>%\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) %>%\n  opt_row_striping () %>%\n  opt_table_lines (\"none\") %>%\n  fmt_percent(\n    column = c(FGPct),\n    decimals = 1\n  ) %>%\n    tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"red\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Name == \"Jimmy Butler\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      How Jimmy Butler Ranks in Playoff Shooting Percentage\n    \n    \n      Butler tops the list with the best shooting percentage in the 2022 playoffs\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Name\n      Shooting Percentage\n      Steals\n      Rebounds\n      Points\n    \n  \n  \n    Jimmy Butler\n50.6%\n35\n125\n466\n    Giannis Antetokounmpo\n49.1%\n8\n170\n380\n    Stephen Curry\n46.1%\n28\n112\n586\n    Klay Thompson\n42.8%\n24\n83\n400\n    James Harden\n41.1%\n8\n63\n201\n  \n  \n    \n      By: Hollan Griesch  |  Source: hoopR: The SportsDataverse's R Package for Men's Basketball Data\n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nCode\nggsave(\"image.png\")\n\n\nWhen the playoffs roll around Jimmy Butler takes his game to another level. Compared to some of the leagues best shooters, Butler held the highest shooting percentage. He shot over 50% from the field in the 2022 postseason and also led these players in steals.\nAmong this list he was second in rebounds only to Giannis Antetokounmpo which is not surprising and trailed only Steph Curry in total points. However, Curry also played in six more games then Butler as he led the Warriors to another championship.\nLets take a closer look at how Butler’s point totals during the 2022 postseason compared to the league average.\n\n\nCode\naverage <- nbaplayerbox %>% \n  summarise(mean_points = mean(points, na.rm=TRUE))\n\nbutler <- nbaplayerbox %>% filter(athlete_display_name == \"Jimmy Butler\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=butler, aes(x=game_date, y=points), color = \"red\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 10.41) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 50)) +\n   labs(y = \"Points\",\n        x = \"Game Date\",\n       title = \"Jimmy Butler's Postseason Point Totals\",\n       subtitle = \"Butler far exceeded the league average in points scored during the postseason\",\n      caption=\" By Hollan Griesch | Source: hoopR: The SportsDataverse's R Package for Men's Basketball Data\") +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nButler’s impact on the court goes well beyond just the points that he scores. He is also an elite defender and gets the task of guarding the other team’s best player nearly every game. His hustle and leadership while on the court also consistently provide a spark for the Heat.\nThere is a noticeable difference in the intensity and pace of the game for Miami when there star is on the court versus when he is not and this impact isn’t something that point totals alone can show.\nLet’s look at how Butler’s impact on the game compares to other prominent players at his same position in the league.\n\n\nCode\nnewplayers <- c(\"Jimmy Butler\", \"Jayson Tatum\", \"Khris Middleton\", \"Jaylen Brown\", \"Klay Thompson\")\n\nnbaplayers <- postseason2022 %>% \n  filter(athlete_display_name %in% newplayers)\n\nnewnbaplayers <- nbaplayers %>%\n  mutate(plus_minus = as.numeric(plus_minus))\n\nnbadata <- newnbaplayers %>% \n  group_by(athlete_display_name) %>% \n  summarise(\n    count = n(),\n    TotalPlusMinus = sum(plus_minus),\n    TotalGames = n()\n  ) %>%\n  mutate(\n    PlusMinus = TotalPlusMinus/TotalGames\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=nbadata, aes(x=reorder(athlete_display_name, PlusMinus), weight=PlusMinus)) +\n  coord_flip() +\n     labs(\n    x=\"Name\", \n    y=\"Plus Minus\", \n    title=\"Small Forwards Plus Minus in the 2021-22 Playoffs\", \n    subtitle=\"Jimmy Butler topped this group in average plus minus during the postseason\", \n    caption=\"Source: hoopR The SportsDataverse's R Package for Men's Basketball Data | By Hollan Griesch\"\n    )   +             \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    title = element_text(color = \"black\", size = 10, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 8, color = \"black\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\nAmong some of the leagues best small forwards, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Klay Thompson, and Khris Middleton, Jimmy Butler tops the list for best plus minus. Plus minus keeps track of the net changes in the score when a given player is either on or off the court.\nThe Miami Heat were five and a half points better when Jimmy Butler was on the court last postseason. These five points can make the difference in a tight playoff game when it comes down to the final stretch.\nClearly, Butler is the driving force behind the Heat’s success the past couple seasons and his playoff performances will be something that Heat fans will remember forever."

From 2000-2019 the Big Ten placed 16 teams in the Final Four, the most of any conference during that time.\nThis success has started to shift with only one of the eight Big Ten teams in the tournament making it to the Sweet Sixteen this past season. The Big Ten also had a historically bad showing in the 2021-22 NCAA tournament when each of their five teams seeded eight or higher performed below expectations.\nThe question is what is causing this?

In fact, Penn State was the only team that actually improved their three point shooting from the regular to post season.\nObviously the biggest story of this year’s tournament was the upset of one-seeded Purdue by 16-seeded Fairleigh Dickson.

The decrease in their three point percentage combined with this decline in overall field goal percentage proved to be a recipe for disaster for the Boilermakers.\nThe struggles offensively were visible all across the board for the Big Ten as six of the eight tournament teams saw a smaller percentage of their shots fall then they did during the regular season.\nLets see if the teams were able to make up for slow offense with their defense.\n\n\nCode\nturnovers <- bigpost %>%\n  group_by(team_short_display_name) %>%\n  summarise (\n    Giveaways = sum(total_turnovers),\n    Takeaways = sum(steals)) %>%\nrename(Team = team_short_display_name)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=turnovers, \n    aes(y=Team, x=Takeaways, xend=Giveaways),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") +\n  labs(\n    title=\"Did Big Ten team's win the turnover battle in the postseason?\", \n    subtitle = \"No Big Ten team had more steals than turnovers in the tournament\",\n    caption=\"Source: hoopR | By Hollan Griesch\"\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    title = element_text(color = \"black\", size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11),\n    axis.text = element_text(size =8, color = \"black\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Big Ten team’s were not able to win the turnover battle in the NCAA tournament which coupled with struggling offense resulted in another disappointing postseason for the conference.\nIt is clear that the Big Ten has been underperforming in March Madness the past few seasons and that begs the question is it just bad luck? Based on the fact that Big Ten teams have had worse performances in nearly every category in the postseason compared to the regular season there has to be more to blame than just bad luck.\nIt will be interesting to see if the conference can turn this underachievement around and get back to their winning ways since the conference hasn’t produced a national champion since Michigan State back in 2000."
