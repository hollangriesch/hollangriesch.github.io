    "text": "March used to be the month when Big Ten teams shined. From 2000-2019 the Big Ten placed 16 teams in the Final Four, the most of any conference during that time.\nThis success has started to shift with only one of the eight Big Ten teams in the tournament making it to the Sweet Sixteen this past season. The Big Ten also had a historically bad showing in the 2021-22 NCAA tournament when each of their five teams seeded eight or higher performed below expectations.\nThe question is what is causing this? Are Big Ten teams really playing that much worse in the postseason compared to the regular season? Or is it just some bad luck?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nmbb_team_box <- hoopR::load_mbb_team_box(2023)\n\nregularseason23 <- mbb_team_box %>% filter(game_date > \"2022-11-07\" & game_date <= \"2023-03-12\") \n\nbig10 <- c(\"Nebraska\", \"Iowa\", \"Indiana\", \"Illinois\", \"Maryland\", \"Rutgers\", \"Michigan\", \"Michigan St\", \"Ohio State\", \"Penn State\", \"Northwestern\", \"Purdue\", \"Minnesota\", \"Wisconsin\")\nbigregular <- regularseason23 %>%\n  filter(team_short_display_name %in% big10)\n\ntournament <- c(\"Maryland\", \"Illinois\", \"Indiana\", \"Iowa\", \"Michigan St\", \"Northwestern\", \"Penn State\", \"Purdue\")\n\npostseason23 <- mbb_team_box %>% filter(game_date > \"2023-03-14\" & game_date <= \"2023-04-03\")\n\nbigpost <- postseason23 %>%\n  filter(team_short_display_name %in% tournament)\n\nregularthreepct <- bigregular %>% \n  group_by(team_short_display_name) %>% \n  summarise(\n    count = n(),\n    SeasonThreePct = sum(three_point_field_goal_pct),\n    TotalGames = n()\n  ) %>%\n  mutate(\n    ThreePointPct = SeasonThreePct/TotalGames\n  )\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = regularthreepct, aes(x = reorder(team_short_display_name, ThreePointPct), weight = ThreePointPct)) +\n  coord_flip() +\n   labs(\n    x=\"School\", \n    y=\"Three Point Percentage\", \n    title=\"How did Big Ten teams shoot the three in the regular season?\", \n    subtitle=\"Michigan State led the conference in regular season three point percentage\", \n    caption=\"Source: hoopR | By Hollan Griesch\"\n    )   +             \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    title = element_text(color = \"black\", size = 10, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 8, color = \"red\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggsave(\"image.png\")\n\npostthreepct <- bigpost %>% \n  group_by(team_short_display_name) %>% \n  summarise(\n    count = n(),\n    SeasonThreePct = sum(three_point_field_goal_pct),\n    TotalGames = n()\n  ) %>%\n  mutate(\n    ThreePointPct = SeasonThreePct/TotalGames\n  )\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = postthreepct, aes(x = reorder(team_short_display_name, ThreePointPct), weight = ThreePointPct)) +\n  coord_flip() +\n   labs(\n    x=\"School\", \n    y=\"Three Point Percentage\", \n    title=\"How did Big Ten teams shoot the three in the post season?\", \n    subtitle=\"Penn State took over having the best three point percentage in the NCAA tournament\", \n    caption=\"Source: hoopR | By Hollan Griesch\"\n    )   +             \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    title = element_text(color = \"black\", size = 10, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 8, color = \"red\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\nIn the regular season, no Big Ten teams shot under 30% from beyond the arc.\nHowever, in the NCAA tournament four of the conference’s eight teams shot below that mark. In fact, Penn State was the only team that actually improved their three point shooting from the regular to post season.\nObviously the biggest story of this year’s tournament was the upset of one-seeded Purdue by 16-seeded Fairleigh Dickson. Let’s take a look at what went wrong with the Boilermakers during March Madness.\n\n\nCode\nbigmbb <- bigregular %>%\n  select(team_short_display_name, field_goals_attempted, field_goals_made, field_goal_pct) %>%\n  mutate_at(vars(-team_short_display_name), as.numeric) %>%\n  group_by(team_short_display_name) %>%\n  summarize(\n    TotalFG = sum(field_goals_made),\n    TotalFGA = sum(field_goals_attempted)\n  ) %>%\n  mutate(FGPct = TotalFG/TotalFGA) %>%\n  rename(Team = team_short_display_name) %>%\n  select(Team, FGPct) %>%\n  arrange(desc(FGPct)) \n\nbigmbb %>%\n  gt() %>%\n  cols_label(\n    FGPct = \"Shooting Percentage\"\n  ) %>%\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"How did the Big Ten's best team shoot in the regular season?\",\n    subtitle = \"Purdue was third in field goal percentage before the NCAA tournament\"\n  ) %>% tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) %>% tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) %>%\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Hollan Griesch  |  **Source:** hoopR\")\n ) %>%\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) %>%\n  opt_row_striping() %>% \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") %>%\n  fmt_percent(\n    columns = c(FGPct),\n    decimals = 1\n  ) %>%\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"gold\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Team == \"Purdue\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      How did the Big Ten's best team shoot in the regular season?\n    \n    \n      Purdue was third in field goal percentage before the NCAA tournament\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Team\n      Shooting Percentage\n    \n  \n  \n    Indiana\n48.5%\n    Penn State\n46.1%\n    Purdue\n45.9%\n    Ohio State\n45.9%\n    Nebraska\n45.7%\n    Iowa\n45.3%\n    Illinois\n45.0%\n    Michigan St\n45.0%\n    Maryland\n44.8%\n    Michigan\n44.6%\n    Minnesota\n43.3%\n    Rutgers\n42.8%\n    Wisconsin\n41.1%\n    Northwestern\n40.5%\n  \n  \n    \n      By: Hollan Griesch  |  Source: hoopR\n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nCode\nbigpostmbb <- bigpost %>%\n  select(team_short_display_name, field_goals_attempted, field_goals_made, field_goal_pct) %>%\n  mutate_at(vars(-team_short_display_name), as.numeric) %>%\n  group_by(team_short_display_name) %>%\n  summarize(\n    TotalFG = sum(field_goals_made),\n    TotalFGA = sum(field_goals_attempted)\n  ) %>%\n  mutate(FGPct = TotalFG/TotalFGA) %>%\n  rename(Team = team_short_display_name) %>%\n  select(Team, FGPct) %>%\n  arrange(desc(FGPct))\n\nbigpostmbb %>%\n  gt() %>%\n  cols_label(\n    FGPct = \"Shooting Percentage\"\n  ) %>%\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Now how did they shoot in the post season?\",\n    subtitle = \"Purdue was at the bottom of the Big Ten for shooting percentage in the NCAA tournament\"\n  ) %>% tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) %>% tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) %>%\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Hollan Griesch  |  **Source:** hoopR\")\n ) %>%\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) %>%\n  opt_row_striping() %>% \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") %>%\n  fmt_percent(\n    columns = c(FGPct),\n    decimals = 1\n  ) %>%\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"gold\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Team == \"Purdue\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Now how did they shoot in the post season?\n    \n    \n      Purdue was at the bottom of the Big Ten for shooting percentage in the NCAA tournament\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Team\n      Shooting Percentage\n    \n  \n  \n    Michigan St\n47.4%\n    Penn State\n44.8%\n    Indiana\n44.0%\n    Northwestern\n42.9%\n    Maryland\n42.4%\n    Iowa\n41.2%\n    Illinois\n38.5%\n    Purdue\n35.8%\n  \n  \n    \n      By: Hollan Griesch  |  Source: hoopR\n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nWhen the postseason rolled around Purdue’s field goal percentage dropped by a whopping 10%. The decrease in their three point percentage combined with this decline in overall field goal percentage proved to be a recipe for disaster for the Boilermakers.\nThe struggles offensively were visible all across the board for the Big Ten as six of the eight tournament teams saw a smaller percentage of their shots fall then they did during the regular season.\nLets see if the teams were able to make up for slow offense with their defense.\n\n\nCode\nturnovers <- bigpost %>%\n  group_by(team_short_display_name) %>%\n  summarise (\n    Giveaways = sum(total_turnovers),\n    Takeaways = sum(steals)) %>%\nrename(Team = team_short_display_name)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=turnovers, \n    aes(y=Team, x=Takeaways, xend=Giveaways),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") +\n  labs(\n    title=\"Did Big Ten team's win the turnover battle in the postseason?\", \n    subtitle = \"No Big Ten team had more steals than turnovers in the tournament\",\n    caption=\"Source: hoopR | By Hollan Griesch\"\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    title = element_text(color = \"black\", size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11),\n    axis.text = element_text(size =8, color = \"black\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Big Ten team’s were not able to win the turnover battle in the NCAA tournament which coupled with struggling offense resulted in another disappointing postseason for the conference.\nIt is clear that the Big Ten has been underperforming in March Madness the past few seasons and that begs the question is it just bad luck? Based on the fact that Big Ten teams have had worse performances in nearly every category in the postseason compared to the regular season there has to be more to blame than just bad luck.\nIt will be interesting to see if the conference can turn this underachievement around and get back to their winning ways since the conference hasn’t produced a national champion since Michigan State back in 2000."
